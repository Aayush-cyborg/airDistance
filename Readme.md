ðŸ‘‹Hey There!!! This is my HACK-2 Assignment
======================================================

Here you go â‹™â‹™â‹™â‹™

Directory Layout
======================================================
* [airDistance](https://github.com/Aayush-cyborg/airDistance)---------------------------# Application repository
   * [.gitignore](https://github.com/Aayush-cyborg/airDistance/blob/main/.gitignore)  -----------------------# .gitignore file
   * [Test-cases](https://github.com/Aayush-cyborg/airDistance/blob/main/Test-cases)-----------------------# 3 Test cases designed according to selected latitude and longitude
   * [airDistance.c](https://github.com/Aayush-cyborg/airDistance/blob/main/airDistance.c)--------------------# Main source code written in C language to calculaate distance

Your output should look something like the following.
======================================================
If you run C program with help of following test cases you will receive similar output mentioned below for example:-

  [Test-cases](https://github.com/Aayush-cyborg/airDistance/blob/main/Test-cases)

  [AirDistance.c](https://github.com/Aayush-cyborg/airDistance/blob/main/airDistance.c)

Location Distance
======================================================

Origin: (41.948300, -87.655600)

Destination: (40.820600, -96.705600)

Air distance is 764.990931 kms




Instructions
======================================================

>Design at least 3 test cases before you begin designing or implementing your program. Test cases are input-output pairs that are known to be correct using means other than your program (a calculator, online tool, etc.).

>Remember to RTM (Read The Manual) on the math library to see which function(s) you may find useful and how to use them.
